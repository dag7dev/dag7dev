## :book: About Me
- 🎓 Studying Computer Science at University
- 🌐 You can access all my open-source projects [here on Github](https://github.com/dag7dev/) or [on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dag7)
- 🦊 I am a Mozillian! Proud contributor of [Mozilla Italia](https://github.com/MozillaItalia/) and volounteer of the Mozilla's reps program
- 💻 Serial distro-hopper: I used to use Arch, but right now I am using [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/). Once you try the AUR power, you'd never come back again to any other thing!
 
## ⬆ What I'm up to
- 🔨 I'm currently contributing to open source projects here, on Github
- 🎯 In the near future, I plan to...
  - Work on [**The Homebrew Hub**](https://github.com/gbdev/homebrewhub) using **Django** and finish scrapers for [**GB Dev**](https://github.com/gbdev/database)
  - Make a game or a homebrew for the Game Boy 👾
  - ~~Update [**magic-startup-arch-sh**](https://github.com/dag7dev/magic-startup-arch-sh) and my [**dotfiles folder**](https://github.com/dag7dev/dotfiles)~~ **DONE, check them out here!**
  - Finish University: what do you expected? It is a thing.
  - Write some articles on Medium
- 🤞 One day I hope to...
	- Visit 🇯🇵 and 🇨🇳
  - Contribute to [Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) or any other worldwide spread project
  - Install Gentoo (not really, but I am a distro-hopper and Gentoo is missing)
  - Get an internship in a videogame company (if you have this power, hire me as soon as possible)

## 🔨 Things you may find interesting
- [**PyDBHelper**](https://github.com/dag7dev/PyDBHelper): a helper to find out the 3NF of a schema and many other things. It is perfect if you're planning to challenge yourself.
- [**JSQuizee**](https://github.com/dag7dev/JSQuizee): a completely client-side quiz engine. Keep in mind that when this have been built, I wanted to let anyone use this on any webpage, including Github Pages. For this reason I did not implemented a classic client-server engine.
- [**another-one-the-game**](https://github.com/dag7dev/another-one-the-game.git): a game that uses DeepSpeech as voice recognizer.
- [**WAProperRenamer**](https://github.com/dag7dev/WAProperRenamer): Python script which renames all your Whatsapp Photos in a proper way. Useful to organize photos. 
- [**risc-v-exercises**](https://github.com/dag7dev/risc-v-exercises-2020): I dig everywhere on the web, but this is the only place where I found some RISC-V snippets.
