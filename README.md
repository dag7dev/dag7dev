## 👋 Hi
I'm Damiano, many of you will know me as `dag7` since it is my public nickname or simply `dag`.

Devops and developer, I'm passionate on many other things, like casual shooting photos, writing about my experiences, watching movies, and playing board games and videogames, even if I don’t often have the time to do all of these things in the measure I would.
i'll take your brain to another dimension
