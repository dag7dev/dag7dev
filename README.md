## 🔨 Some of my projects
- [**Stufftrack**](https://github.com/nobody-productions/stufftrack): tracker for videogames and books. It is not a final project, rather than a PoC...

- [**JSQuizee**](https://github.com/dag7dev/JSQuizee): a completely client-side quiz engine. Keep in mind that when this have been built, I wanted to let anyone use this on any webpage, including Github Pages. For this reason I did not implemented a classic client-server engine.

- [**another-one-the-game**](https://github.com/dag7dev/another-one-the-game.git): a game that uses DeepSpeech as voice recognizer.

- [**WAProperRenamer**](https://github.com/dag7dev/WAProperRenamer): Python script which renames all your Whatsapp Photos in a proper way. Useful to organize photos. 

- [**risc-v-exercises**](https://github.com/dag7dev/risc-v-exercises-2020): I dig everywhere on the web, but this is the only place where I found some RISC-V snippets.
