- 🌐 You can access all my open-source projects [here on Github](https://github.com/dag7dev/) or [on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dag7)

 <summary><b>🔨 Things you may find interesting</b></summary>

- [**PyDBHelper**](https://github.com/dag7dev/PyDBHelper): a helper to find out the 3NF of a schema and many other things. It is perfect if you're planning to challenge yourself.

- [**JSQuizee**](https://github.com/dag7dev/JSQuizee): a completely client-side quiz engine. Keep in mind that when this have been built, I wanted to let anyone use this on any webpage, including Github Pages. For this reason I did not implemented a classic client-server engine.

- [**another-one-the-game**](https://github.com/dag7dev/another-one-the-game.git): a game that uses DeepSpeech as voice recognizer.

- [**WAProperRenamer**](https://github.com/dag7dev/WAProperRenamer): Python script which renames all your Whatsapp Photos in a proper way. Useful to organize photos. 

- [**risc-v-exercises**](https://github.com/dag7dev/risc-v-exercises-2020): I dig everywhere on the web, but this is the only place where I found some RISC-V snippets.
